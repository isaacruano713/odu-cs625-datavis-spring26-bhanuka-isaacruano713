### Q2 - Pull Command

The pull command sends remote changes to local.

### Q3 - Local Commits

If you committed a change locally but do not see it update on GitHub.com, that is because you did not push the commit. The change has not been shared with GitHub.

## Markdown

### Q1 - Bulleted List

* Eggs
* Bacon

The is different from a numbered list because numbered list use numbers, letters, or numerals, or other ordered symbols instead of bullets to list out the items and give a sense of ordering to the items.

1. Wake up
2. Eat breakfast
3. Eat lunch
4. Eat dinner
5. Go to sleep

### Q2 - Markdown Paragraph

I remember the *dark*, *cold* night when the great **bad** attacked. I was tucked in bed, dead asleep, when the sound awoke me. _**Clickety Clackety**_, the nails of the creature tapped against the floor as it drew closer. I flashed open my eyes as soon as I heard it coming, but it was too late. The `creature` jumped on my bed and went straight for my face! And then he sniffed my, licked my face, and curled up before falling asleep with me. Happy that my dog was now by my side, I fell back [asleep](https://paw-tastic-walks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dog-Sleeping-Next-to-You-at-Night-1.jpg).

## Google Colab

### Q1 - URL of Google Colab Notebook

## Python/Seaborn

### Q1 - First Penguin Image

![First Plot](CS-625-HW1-Python-Plot-1.png)

This first plot is a scatterplot of the bill depth in millimeters vs the bill length. In the plot, it appears that there are three clusters, and within each cluster, there is a weak positive linear correlation between the bill depth and the bill length.

### Q2 - Second Penguin Image

![First Plot](CS-625-HW1-Python-Plot-2.png)

This second plot is a bar plot of the average mass of each species of penguin. It appears that the Gentoo species tends to be quite a bit larger than the other two, but the other two species are very close in average mass.

### Q3 - Outer Parenthesis

When you remove the parentheses, you get a syntax error. You get this error because Python assumes that the first line of code is finished if there are no parentheses to indicate that the code should continue onto the next line. Because of this, Python reads the second line as something incomplete.
